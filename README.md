## All playlists on the Channel
1. __New to Natural Language Processing? Start with "Decoding NLP Libraries"__ - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsAqq9lZFOtUKvo2BIEOTfb1gqXd97P7B
    * This playlist decodes popular functionalities/methods from popular NLP libraries in python in  great detail. This playlist will help you develop basic concepts in NLP. A must follow resource for starters and enthusiasts.
2. __Evaluating Text Generation Systems__ - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsAqq9lZFOtXlzg5RNyV00ueE89PwnCbu
    * Text generation is the task of generating text with the goal of appearing indistinguishable to human-written text. Evaluating such systems is not straight forward due to unavailability of any robust metric that correlates well with human decisions. This playlist lists down research paper walkthroughs for evaluating text generation systems from top-tier conferences like EMNLP, ACL, ICML, etc
3. __Data Augmentation in Natural Language Processing__ - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsAqq9lZFOtUg63g_95OuV-R2GhV1UiIZ
    * Data augmentation in data analysis are techniques used to increase the amount of data by adding slightly modified copies of already existing data or newly created synthetic data from existing data. It acts as a regularizer and helps reduce overfitting when training a machine learning model. It is closely related to oversampling in data analysis. This playlist talks about Data Augmentation techniques in Natural Language Processing(NLP) from top machine learning/linguistics conferences.
4. __BERT in Natural Language Processing (NLP) Usecases__ - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsAqq9lZFOtX-WN8lldIOI7p-p0lBzjtY
    * Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a Transformer-based machine learning technique for natural language processing (NLP) pre-training developed by Google. BERT was created and published in 2018 by Jacob Devlin and his colleagues from Google. As of 2019, Google has been leveraging BERT to better understand user searches. In this playlist you will find relevant research paper walkthroughs of BERT usecases in Natural Language Processing (NLP) from top machine learning/linguistics conferences.
5. __Text Style Transfer in Natural Language Processing__ - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsAqq9lZFOtWrje_u_X6q5RrZacP4gNL2
    * Text style transfer is the task of changing the stylistic properties (e.g., sentiment) of the text while retaining the style-independent content within the context. Since the deﬁnition of the text style is vague, it is difﬁcult to construct paired sen- tences with the same content and differing styles.  In this playlist, you will find relevant Research Papers walkthroughs on Text Style Transfer in (Natural Language Processing) NLP domain from top machine learning/linguistics conferences.
6. __Automatic Text Summarisation in Natural Language Processing__ - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsAqq9lZFOtV8jYq3JlkqPQUN5QxcWq0f
   * Automatic summarization is the process of shortening a set of data computationally, to create a subset (a summary) that represents the most important or relevant information within the original content. There are two general approaches to automatic summarization: extractive and abstractive.  In this playlist, you will find relevant Research Papers walkthroughs on Text Summarisation in (Natural Language Processing) NLP domain from top machine learning/linguistics conferences.
      * Text Summarization of COVID-19 Medical Articles using BERT and GPT-2 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC5kP1dPAzc&list=PLsAqq9lZFOtV8jYq3JlkqPQUN5QxcWq0f&index=1
